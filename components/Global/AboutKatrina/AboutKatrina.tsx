        I create as an act of healing, connection, expression, and energetic
        exchange. <em>I make to know who I am.</em>

      <p>Thank you for visiting, I really love that you're here!</p>

      <p>
        There are three tenderly held intentions that steer Moonbelly: to know
        myself and the world better through the process of making and sharing,
        to foster and nurture a powerful connection between myself as a human
        and the rest of nature, and to bask in this abundant, rich, beautiful,
        magnificent, and magical existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, through the projects I share here I strive to find ways to
        support my main aim:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>to live a decorated life.</strong> âœ¨
