          <em>Hello you!</em> Welcome to Moonbelly Makes, the virtual vessel for
          sharing my homemade projects, both from the craft studio and from the
          kitchen! Feel free to explore the website, find me on Instagram or

          I create as an act of healing, connection, expression, and energetic
          exchange. <em>I make to know who I am.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting, I really love that you're here!</p>

        <p>
          There are three tenderly held intentions that steer Moonbelly: to know
          myself and the world better through the process of making and sharing,
          to foster and nurture a powerful connection between myself as a human
          and the rest of nature, and to bask in this abundant, rich, beautiful,
          magnificent, and magical existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, through the projects I share here I strive to find ways to
          support my main aim:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>to live a decorated life.</strong> âœ¨
