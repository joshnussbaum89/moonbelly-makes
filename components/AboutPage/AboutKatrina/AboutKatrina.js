        <h3>Welcome to Moonbelly makesâ€¦</h3>
        <h4>â€¦the online container for my homemade projects!</h4>
        <p>
          The philosophies that drive Moonbelly start with the aim to live an
          abundant, rich, and magnificent existence. It is important to me to
          feed my body, eyes, and heart with magic and beauty. The phrase
          <em> decorate your life </em>serves as a compass needle that reminds
          me to approach projects and practices with integrity and care.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, a connection with nature is vital, so I am always searching
          for new methods of bringing the natural, outside world into my inside
          world; both into my home by incorporating natural elements and themes
          into my projects, and into my body with delicious, nutrient rich,
          dishes that feel like a soul-hug.
        </p>
        <p>
          I create as an act of healing, output, expression, and energy
          exchange. And I think (for me at least) making might just be the
          meaning of life ðŸ˜Š
