          <h3>Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            The vessel that is Moonbelly has been born from a turning and tuning
            into the closeness I have felt to the process of making for my whole
            life. I have always found more of myself within my projects -
            whether it be sewing, crocheting, cooking, baking, writing,
            choreographing, creating installation art or stop motion films or
            furniture, etc etc etc, these projects come from a deep and wise
            place that I do not understand and therefore cannot explain. They
            then emerge into this reality as a bridge that teaches me something
            about the world and about myself, that connects me with others and
            grounds my being. Both within process and when being witnessed, I
            practice opening my ears and mind and heart to the truth, in
            whatever way it chooses to show up for me.
          </p>
          <p>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</p>
          <p>
            Another massive piece that drives my making is a purposeful attempt
            to challenge societal understandings that suggest we are somehow
            outside of and made of different stuff than the rest of nature. In
            practice, that looks like blurring the line between NATURE/THE
            COSMOS and ME - seeking out new ways to bring the natural, outside
            world into my inside world; both into my home by incorporating
            natural materials and themes into my projects, and into my body with
            (always) delicious and (usually) nutrient rich dishes that work to
            honor the land, people, and animals that nourish me and my family.

          <p>
            Ultimately, the energy that drives Moonbelly is a tenderly held
            intention to bask in this abundant, rich, beautiful, magnificent,
            and magical existence.

            Through the projects I share here, I strive to find ways to support
            my main aim:

            <strong>to live a decorated life.</strong> üå∑
