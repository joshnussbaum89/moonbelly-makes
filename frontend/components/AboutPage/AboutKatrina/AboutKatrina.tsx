          <h2>Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            The project of Moonbelly Makes emerges from a turning and tuning into the closeness I
            have felt to the process of making for my whole life. The urge and inspiration to create
            comes from a deep and wise place that I do not understand and therefore cannot explain,
            but I have always found more of myself within my projects: choreographing, sewing,
            crocheting, cooking, baking, writing, creating installation art and stop motion films
            and furniture, etc etc etc. These projects emerge into this reality as a bridge that
            teaches me something about the world and about myself, that connects me with others and
            grounds my being. (Both within process and when being witnessed, I practice opening my
            ears and mind and heart to the truth, in whatever way it chooses to show up for me.)
          </p>
          <p>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</p>
          <p>
            Another massive piece that drives my making in general and Moonbelly specifically is a
            purposeful attempt to challenge societal understandings that suggest we as humans are
            somehow outside of and made of different stuff than the rest of nature. In practice,
            that looks like blurring the line between NATURE and ME - seeking out new ways to bring
            the natural, <em>outside</em> world into my <em>inside</em> world; both into my home by
            incorporating natural materials and themes into my projects, and into my body with
            delicious and nutrient rich dishes that work to respect and honor the land, people, and
            animals that nourish me, and my family and friends.

            Ultimately, the energy that drives Moonbelly is a tenderly held intention to bask in
            this abundant, rich, beautiful, magnificent, and magical existence.
